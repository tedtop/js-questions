// Outputs: Aurelio De Rosa â€“ I'm not sure why this is. I thought that variables are scoped to the containing function. I thought that this.fullname would refer to obj.fullname because of this. Why does this.fullname refer to obj.prop.fullname?

var test = obj.prop.getFullname;
var newTest = obj.prop.getFullname.bind(obj);

console.log(test());
// Outputs: John Doe - obj.prop.getFullname is assigned to test which is called with the global context, therefore the this.fullname refers to the global var fullname = 'John Doe'

console.log(newTest());
// Outputs: Colin Ihrig - obj.prop.getFullname is assigned to newTest. The this keyword is set to obj with bind(obj), therefore this.fullname refers to obj.fullname: 'Colin Ihrig'
